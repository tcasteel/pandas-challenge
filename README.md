Summary:

After Merging both of the CSVs that were provided, a main summary of both of the CSVs were able to be created
The sumarry included the students, what school they went to, the schools size, the schools budget, the schools type, the students grade, their gender, and the students scores for math and reading

After the merge, a top down summary was created to be able to view the total of all the schools data points

After doing a top down summary of everything, worked to create a per school summary basis to work on the rest of the needed data analysis

From the main over view and using the main database and everything in it, a school by school basis summary was able to be created.
The school by school basis goes over the average scores for the schools, the passing rate of the schools, the type of schools that they are, and the average price per student.

Then after the per school was made, a top school summary was able to be created to show which schools were the most successful, by using Head with setting the column of overall passing.
Then there was also a summary of the worst proforming schools, using a similar tactic to the top school summary but using Tail insead of Head.

The next summary was the average grades for math and reading in seperate summary tables, ranging from 9th grade to 12th grade.

Using the previous data, we are able to find the average scores in the range of the amount that was spent on each student.
Then using a similar style of code, we are able to find the average score for school sizes.
Then to narrow it further, using again a similar line of code as the previous 2 summary tables, but finding the average scores depending on the type of school, either district or charter.

Data Analysis:

Conclusion one:
Using the Three summary tables towards the end of the code, it seems that the schools the perfom the best are the smaller charter schools with a lower cost per student.
From what I can tell these school may not have a ton of funding so they might be working on their grades to ensure that they can aquire the funding needed for the students.

Conclusion two:
With having almost twice if not more than that in the budget it seems that the district schools have almost half of the passing rate as the charter schools.
It may be due to it being a public school and needing to fund other activies such as Sports, Theatre, Band, Orchestra, and Choir that are making their budget much higher and harder for the students to focus on their school work, while also having significantly more sutdents on average definitely doesnt help with the fact that the students have less time to be able to learn in the way that they would need to.

Conclusion wrap:
The charter schools have much higher scores and lower budgets than the district schools do, but at a cost of having much less studnets, which can be a really good thing for students to get the help that they need on assignments that they may not understand to well. While with the districts they seem to cost much more than the charter schools while not doing better in test scores, but at the cost of having significantly more students than the charter schools on average, making it possibly hard on the students to be able to get any extra help they would possibly need on anything they struggle with.
